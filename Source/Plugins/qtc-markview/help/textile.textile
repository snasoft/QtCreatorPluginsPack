Tables

A pipe character must be at the beginning and end of every row.

|_. column name1(aaa) |_. column name2 |_. column name3 |
| laura | 111 | Cell 3 |
| Manuel | Vasquez | Cell 3 |

In this example, the "|_." sequence causes the entry to be in bold. There must be no space after the initial pipe character.
Code

Generic example:

@your code here@

Blocks of code:

bc.. puts "This style (notice the double dot) handles blank lines."
puts "This is the second line of code."

puts "This is the fourth."

End the block with p. or with another block tag.

Or alternatively you can use this syntax for small blocks:

bc. puts "This style (notice the single dot) stops at the first blank line."
puts "This is the second line of code."

This is not code.

Headings

You must leave a blank line after each heading.

h1(#id). An HTML first-level heading

h2. An HTML second-level heading

h3. An HTML third-level heading

h4. An HTML fourth-level heading

h5. An HTML fifth-level heading

h6. An HTML sixth-level heading

Blockquotes

bq. This text will be enclosed in an HTML blockquote element.

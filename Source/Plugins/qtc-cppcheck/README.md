##Features
* Automatically check active project after build
* Automatically check active project's files on save
* Manually check any project's file
* Display found error in task pan (with marks in editor)
* Most settings are configurable
* Translation support

##Tips
* Checking for unused functions prevents use of several threads and can decrease performance
* Custom launch parameters are passing *before* plugin's so can take no effect

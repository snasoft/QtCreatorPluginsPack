You can use the script install.sh to copy the xml configuration files to your home dir, as:
     
       $ sh install.sh

The xml files assume:
   1. qpt is already in the PATH, if not ajust the the command line or put qpt inside a directory which is in the PATH variable
   2. the same as (1) for cppcheck
   3. Krazy is installed in /usr/local/Krazy2

Make any adjustments if necessary
